## Introduction

Of course, we use a multi-repo for the SW development of ESysRepo. All the core libraries and the ESysRepo command-line interface are written in C++. The Python wrapper autogenerated with [PySwig](https://libesys.gitlab.io/tools/pyswig/), which is a homebrewed frontend for [Swig](http://www.swig.org/) is still a work in progress.

The CI is a core element of the project, as it allows:
- formatting checks, using the tool [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), itself using many tools like [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html), [cmake-format](https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format), [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
- generate and deploy this static web page. The static webpage tool used is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
- run unit tests and report their results
- run static and dynamic code analyzer: [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/), [valgrind](https://www.valgrind.org/).

## Git repositories

Here, the main git repos are listed, and they are holding:
- [the manifest](https://gitlab.com/libesys/esysbuild/manifest)
- [the development environement](https://gitlab.com/libesys/esysbuild/dev)
- [ESysRepo source code](https://gitlab.com/libesys/esysrepo/esysrepo)

Some notes:
- Don't get confused that the manifest is in a repository found at esysbuild/manifest. ESysRepo is simply one component of a larger project.
- Currently, the Google repo manifest is used for development, so the file [default.xml](https://gitlab.com/libesys/esysbuild/manifest/-/blob/master/default.xml).

If you have looked at the manifest file, you will have noticed that quite a few more git ESys repositories are used, and they are holding:
- [a set of reusable CMake functions](https://gitlab.com/libesys/esys_cmake_scripts)
- [a platform-independent plugin library](https://gitlab.com/libesys/esysbase)
- [a platform-independent library to handle XML files](https://gitlab.com/libesys/esysfile)
- [a platform-independent logging library](https://gitlab.com/libesys/esyslog/esyslog)
- [common files used for Visual C++ builds](https://gitlab.com/libesys/esysmsvc)
- [a testing framework](https://gitlab.com/libesys/esystest)

ESsyReo uses a sizeable list of external libraries. If interested, one can look at the manifest for the complete list.
